# [Build APIs With GraphQL][published url]
## Instructor: [Markus Mühlberger][instructor url]


RESTful APIs are great: they follow a resource-oriented approach, that is well structured and clear. But when the data gets more and more complex, the routes get longer and longer, and sometimes it isn’t even possible to fetch the data you want with only one request. This is where GraphQL comes into play. It’s designed to work with data represented by a graph, and has a powerful query syntax for traversing, retrieving and mutating data.

In this course, Markus Mühlberger will show you how to build a back-end GraphQL API. You'll start by using an interactive demo server to explore the basics of GraphQL and the syntax. Then you'll move on to implementing your own GraphQL server—a database of information about Star Wars charachters—complete with queries, custom types, mutations, and a number of other advanced GraphQL features.
